React Native Animation Assignment Documentation.

Summary:-
This documentation provides detailed instructions for implementing three common animations in React Native: Fade In, Slide, and Rotate. Each animation will be applied to a button to demonstrate its functionality. This guide covers the theory behind each animation, the necessary setup, and the step-by-step implementation.

Fade In
The Fade In animation gradually changes an element's opacity from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). This effect is often used to make elements appear smoothly on the screen.

Slide
The Slide animation moves an element from one position to another along the x-axis or y-axis. It can be used to create various effects like sliding in from off-screen or moving between positions on the screen.

Rotate
The Rotate animation rotates an element around a pivot point (usually the center). The rotation can be continuous or to a specified angle, and it can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise.

Conclusion:-

This documentation covers the basics of creating Fade In, Slide, and Rotate animations in React Native. By following these steps, you can enhance the user experience in your applications with smooth and visually appealing animations. Feel free to experiment with the timing and easing options provided by react-native-reanimated to achieve your desired animation effects.
